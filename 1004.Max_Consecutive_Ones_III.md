# Max Consecutive Ones III  

Given a binary array nums and an integer k, return the maximum number of consecutive 1's in the array  
if you can flip at most k 0's.  

Example 1:

Input: nums = [1,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1,0], k = 2  
Output: 6  
Explanation: [1,1,1,0,0,**1,1,1,1,1,1**]  
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.  

Example 2:

Input: nums = [0,0,1,1,0,0,1,1,1,0,1,1,0,0,0,1,1,1,1], k = 3  
Output: 10  
Explanation: [0,0,**1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1**,0,0,0,1,1,1,1]  
Bolded numbers were flipped from 0 to 1. The longest subarray is underlined.  

Constraints:  

- 1 <= nums.length <= 105  
- nums[i] is either 0 or 1.  
- 0 <= k <= nums.length  

Answer:  

``` python3  
class Solution:
    def longestOnes(self, nums: List[int], k: int) -> int:
        # zero is for counting the number of zeros
        # one is for counting the number of ones
        left, zero, one, ans = 0, 0, 0, 0
        for i, v in enumerate(nums):
            if v == 1:
                one += 1
                ans = max(zero+one, ans)
            elif zero < k:
                zero += 1
                ans = max(zero+one, ans)
            else:
                left = i - one - zero
                for j in range(left, i):
                    if nums[j] == 1:
                        one -= 1
                    else:
                        zero -= 1
                        break
                if zero < k:
                    zero += 1
        return ans
```
